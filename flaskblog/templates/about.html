    <h1>About Blog</h1>
    <p>
        This is simply a blog to show my thoughts on the world, ranging from thoughts on Computer Science, to the arts, to music, and maybe
        even some politics :).
    </p>
    <p>
        This blog was built on Python, Flask, Bootstrap, and SQLAlchemy. Its a simple application, and mainly served as a way for me to learn
        more about full stack development.
